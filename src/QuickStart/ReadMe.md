# QuickStart

For a quick introduction to Java, take a look at the `.java` files in this folder.

- [**QuickStart.java**](./QuickStart.java) is a short, simple class that outputs information to the console.
  - [ ] Compile the program by typing `javac QuickStart.java` in the terminal window.
  - [ ] Run the program by typing `java QuickStart` in the terminal window.
  - [ ] Run the program again, this time sending in some words (arguments) to the `main()` method. `java QuickStart Coding is fun`
- [**StartHere.java**](./StartHere.java) is a longer file with lots of comments about various parts of the code. There's also a `// TODO:` item for you to edit on your own.
  - [ ] Compile the program and run it. Run it again, this time by "passing in" a line of text to the program.
  - [ ] Edit the file to complete the TODO task item.
- [**Calculator.java**](./Calculator.java) gets you thinking about how a Java program can be something a user runs from the command-line to perform some task.
  - [ ] On a piece of paper, write down the following for each *method* of the `Calculator` class: The name of the method, the first and last line numbers of the method, and a short phrase describing what the method *does*.
  - [ ] Compile and run the `Calculator` program to see what it does. Try using it to add or subtract two numbers.
  - [ ] Add additional methods for the multiply and divide behaviours. Extend the nested if/else statements in the `main()` method to include support for the user entering in `mult` and `div` when they run the calculator.
